 # Event Local
 
 # Event 1
 sw22_crisis.11.name: "Seismic Disturbances"
 sw22_crisis.11.desc: "There have been a series of unexplained seismic issues on [Root.GetName]. Because of the lack of earthquakes historically planetary administration is understandably concerned."
 sw22_crisis.11.a: "Ignore it, it's just an simple earthquake"
 sw22_crisis.11.b: "Explore it more just in case."

 # Event 2
 sw22_crisis.21.name: "The Land Turns to Ash"
 sw22_crisis.21.desc: "The area directly above the epicenter has started to experience extreme ecological collapse; the soil no longer has any nutrients which has in turn destroyed local plant and animal life. This is highly irregular for earthquakes, something else must be going on."
 sw22_crisis.21.a: "Get to the bottom of this."

 sw22_crisis.22.name: "Tunnel Trouble" 
 sw22_crisis.22.desc: "Geological scans of the affected area have uncovered a series of recently created underground tunnels. While it's too early to tell if they are naturally occurring or not, their creation coincides just a few weeks before the first earthquake."
 sw22_crisis.22.a: "Search those tunnels."
 
 sw22_crisis.23.name: "6,000 Feet Under"
 sw22_crisis.23.desc: "The tunnels are a labyrinth of dead ends and snaking passageways. Whoever, or whatever, has been at this for months before the first earthquake happened. Cave ins in the older parts lead to the earthquakes, but the tunnels lead far away from it. The evidence of the ecological damage is most apparent here, it's clear that we've only seen the first stages of damage. "
 sw22_crisis.23.a: "Bring the truth to the surface."
 
 # Event 3
 sw22_crisis.31.name: "Underground Terrorists "
 sw22_crisis.31.desc: "Our geological teams have been studying the unexpected seismic activity. Furthermore, we are starting to see some unexpected ecological damage in the surrounding area. Deep scans have uncovered a series of recently created tunnels under the affected area; it's too early to tell if it's naturally occurring, but regardless it is of concern."
 sw22_crisis.31.a: "Get a drilling team to investigate."

 sw22_crisis.32.name: "Foiled Erosion"
 sw22_crisis.32.desc: "The tunnel network is extensive, who or what dug them out has been at this for a while. The state in the tunnels indicates there is more ecological damage to come, what is already dying is only a portion of the tunnel network. We have yet to find those responsible, but will continue the search."
 sw22_crisis.32.a: "Dig to the truth."

 # Event 4
 sw22_crisis.41.name: "Worm Your Way Out Of This One"
 sw22_crisis.41.desc: "After a long and grueling search our soldiers found the source of the tunnel network. A giant alien worm of unknown origin was boring below the location where the environmental damage occurred and feeding on the dead soil it left behind. Our soldiers were barely able to slay the beast, its crystalline hide and regenerative qualities made it almost impervious to our weapons. The initial autopsy shows extensive, highly advanced bioengineering much beyond our understanding. Could this be the prelude to an all out attack?"
 sw22_crisis.41.a: "At least this planet is safe for now."


 # Event 5
 sw22_crisis.51.name: "They Hit Everyone"
 sw22_crisis.51.desc: "It appears a worm attacked a planet of every known spacefaring empire. Why they decided now to attack everyone is beyond us, but the galactic community is up in arms, and paranoid runs deep with empires blaming each other and rivals for the attacks."
 sw22_crisis.51.a: "Who could do this?"

 sw22_crisis.61.desc:0 "Surface dwellers of the galaxy; we hope you enjoyed our little display.\n\nWe are the Molonoids, but you can refer to us simply as your new Overlords. Our ancient and advanced empire seeded all of your worlds with our advanced bio-worms long before your people or your creators had tools. The worm you experienced was nothing more than a juvenile, it's size does not even begun to compare to the full grown worms slumbering under your feet even now.\n\nYou all have two choices: Submit or be destroyed.\n\nA representative from our empire will be reaching out shortly to discuss the terms of your surrender."
 sw22_crisis.61.a:0 "How dare they!"
 sw22_crisis.61.b:0 "Did they hang up on us?"

 # Event 6.2 Follow Up 1
 sw22_crisis.62.name:0 "A Tense Galaxy"
 sw22_crisis.62.desc:0 "It's been six months since sudden attacks from the Molonoids and no empire can confirm that they have heard any further demands from them. Were the attacks some kind of elaborate hoax? The galactic community is on edge as empires argue about how to best deal with the Molonoid threat once it surfaces."
 sw22_crisis.62.a:0 "What is going on?"

 # Event 6.3 Follow Up 2 (Crisis Begins)
 sw22_crisis.63.name:0 "It Starts"
 sw22_crisis.63.desc:0 "We had hoped it wouldn't have come to this but your defiance can not be allowed as we will not accept the seeds of rebellion to grow.\n\nUntil all empires have submitted there will escalating amounts of worm attacks on inhabited planets. Once your empire has submitted then attacks will cease.\n\nAs you've already been in touch with our representatives so you know where to reach out to when you're done digging your own graves.\n\nWe look forward to a time after this shaky start and we can work together to build the foundations of lasting interplanetary peace with the rightful rulers of the galaxy in charge."
 sw22_crisis.63.a:0 "You haven't sent anyone, what is going on?"

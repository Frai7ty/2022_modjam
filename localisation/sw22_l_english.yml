 # Event Local
 
 # Event 1
 sw22_crisis.11.name: "Seismic Disturbances"
 sw22_crisis.11.desc: "There have been a series of unexplained seismic issues on [Root.GetName]. Due to the strange circumstances and sudden intensity, planetary administration is understandably concerned."
 sw22_crisis.11.a: "Ignore it, it's just an simple earthquake"
 sw22_crisis.11.b: "Explore it more just in case."

 # Event 2
 sw22_crisis.21.name: "The Land Turns to Ash"
 sw22_crisis.21.desc: "The area directly above the epicenter has started to experience extreme ecological collapse; the soil no longer has any nutrients which has in turn destroyed local plant and animal life. This is highly irregular for earthquakes, something else must be going on."
 sw22_crisis.21.a: "Get to the bottom of this."

 sw22_crisis.22.name: "Tunnel Trouble" 
 sw22_crisis.22.desc: "Geological scans of the affected area have uncovered a series of recently created underground tunnels. While it's too early to tell if they are naturally occurring or not, their creation coincides just a few weeks before the first earthquake."
 sw22_crisis.22.a: "Search those tunnels."
 
 sw22_crisis.23.name: "6,000 Feet Under"
 sw22_crisis.23.desc: "The tunnels are a labyrinth of dead ends and snaking passageways. Whoever, or whatever, has been at this for months before the first earthquake happened. Cave-ins in the older parts lead to earthquakes, but the tunnels lead far away from the current epicenter. The evidence of the ecological damage is most apparent here, it's clear that we've only seen the tip of the iceberg."
 sw22_crisis.23.a: "Bring the truth to the surface."
 
 # Event 3
 sw22_crisis.31.name: "Underground Terrorists "
 sw22_crisis.31.desc: "We have been studying the unexpected seismic activity. Furthermore, we are starting to see some unexpected ecological damage in the surrounding area. Deep scans have uncovered a series of recently created tunnels under the affected area; it's too early to tell if it's naturally occurring, but regardless it is of concern."
 sw22_crisis.31.a: "Get a drilling team to investigate."

 sw22_crisis.32.name: "Foiled Erosion"
 sw22_crisis.32.desc: "The tunnel network is extensive, who or what dug them out has been at this for a while. The state of the tunnels indicates there is more ecological damage to come, what is already dying is only a portion of the tunnel network. We have yet to find those responsible but will continue the search."
 sw22_crisis.32.a: "Unearth the truth."

 # Event 4
 sw22_crisis.41.name: "Worm Your Way Out Of This One"
 sw22_crisis.41.desc: "After a long and grueling search, our soldiers found the source of the tunnel network. A giant alien worm of unknown origin was boring below the location where the environmental damage occurred and feeding on the dead soil it left behind. Our soldiers were barely able to slay the beast, its crystalline hide and regenerative qualities made it almost impervious to our weapons. The initial autopsy shows extensive, highly advanced bioengineering much beyond our understanding. It's unclear if this is the beginning or the end of this."
 sw22_crisis.41.a: "At least this planet is safe for now."


 # Event 5
 sw22_crisis.51.name: "They Hit Everyone"
 sw22_crisis.51.desc: "It appears a worm attacked a planet of every known space faring empire. Why they decided now to attack everyone is beyond us, but the galactic community is up in arms, and paranoia runs deep with empires blaming each other and rivals for the attacks."
 sw22_crisis.51.a: "Who could do this?"

 # Event 6.1
 sw22_crisis.61.name:0 "The Truth Surfaces"
 sw22_crisis.61.desc:0 "Surface dwellers of the galaxy; we hope you enjoyed our little display.\n\nWe are the Molonoids, but you can refer to us simply as your new Overlords. Our ancient and advanced empire seeded all of your worlds with our advanced Bioworms long before your people or your creators had tools. The worm you experienced was nothing more than a juvenile, its size does not even begin to compare to the full-grown worms slumbering under your feet even now.\n\nYou all have two choices: Submit or be destroyed.\n\nA representative from our empire will be reaching out shortly to discuss the terms of your surrender."
 sw22_crisis.61.a:0 "How dare they!"
 sw22_crisis.61.b:0 "Did they hang up on us?"

 # Event 6.2 Follow Up 1
 sw22_crisis.62.name:0 "A Tense Galaxy"
 sw22_crisis.62.desc:0 "It's been six months since sudden attacks from the Molonoids and no empire can confirm that they have heard any further demands from them. The original message's signals bounced through wormholes, off nebulae and through gateways making it impossible to track. The galactic community is on edge as empires argue about how to best deal with the Molonoid threat once it surfaces."
 sw22_crisis.62.a:0 "What is going on?"

 # Event 6.3 Follow Up 2 (Crisis Begins)
 sw22_crisis.63.name:0 "It Starts"
 sw22_crisis.63.desc:0 "We had hoped it wouldn't have come to this, but your defiance can not be allowed. We will not accept the seeds of rebellion to grow.\n\nWorms will continue to attack your planets at random until you have submitted and then, and only then, will they cease.\n\nAs you've already been in touch with our representatives, so you know where to reach out to when you're done digging your own graves.\n\nWe look forward to a time after this shaky start, and we can work together to build the foundations of lasting interplanetary peace as the rightful rulers of the galaxy.."
 sw22_crisis.63.a:0 "You haven't sent anyone, what is going on?"

[sw22_planet_attack_warning.GetName] which is part of [sw22_country_attack_warning.GetName] has reported being under attack from a much larger and much stronger Bioworm. None of their weaponry is having any effect on the creature, so unless they can find a way to stop the worm it could destroy their planet."

 sw22_crisis.72.desc:0 "With this most recent attack on [sw22_planet_attack_warning.GetName] it's become clear that the Molonoids must be stopped, somehow.

Geological scans show thousands of tunnels under the surface, many of which connect to the runs of their sprawling cave cities. With the level of planetary destruction, it's impossible to determine how or why the bioworms got loose and turned on their masters, but we can determine it happened long before the first bioworm attacks.\n\nWe also found one remaining high-security lab that was still in a functioning state. After a simple description, it's clear the bioworm attacks were merely a glitch in aging and damaged systems; it was never meant to go off without the Molonoids in the control seat.

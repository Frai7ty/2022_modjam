 # Event Local
 
 # Event 1
 sw22_crisis.11.name: "Seismic Disturbances"
 sw22_crisis.11.desc: "There have been a series of unexplained seismic issues on [Root.GetName]. Because of the lack of earthquakes historically planetary administration is understandably concerned."
 sw22_crisis.11.a: "Ignore it, it's just an simple earthquake"
 sw22_crisis.11.b: "Explore it more just in case."

 # Event 2
 sw22_crisis.21.name: "The Land Turns to Ash"
 sw22_crisis.21.desc: "The area directly above the epicenter has started to experience extreme ecological collapse; the soil no longer has any nutrients which has in turn destroyed local plant and animal life. This is highly irregular for earthquakes, something else must be going on."
 sw22_crisis.21.a: "Get to the bottom of this."

 sw22_crisis.22.name: "Tunnel Trouble" 
 sw22_crisis.22.desc: "Geological scans of the affected area have uncovered a series of recently created underground tunnels. While it's too early to tell if they are naturally occurring or not, their creation coincides just a few weeks before the first earthquake."
 sw22_crisis.22.a: "Search those tunnels."
 
 sw22_crisis.23.name: "6,000 Feet Under"
 sw22_crisis.23.desc: "The tunnels are a labyrinth of dead ends and snaking passageways. Whoever, or whatever, has been at this for months before the first earthquake happened. Cave ins in the older parts lead to the earthquakes, but the tunnels lead far away from it. The evidence of the ecological damage is most apparent here, it's clear that we've only seen the tip of the mountain of damage. "
 sw22_crisis.23.a: "Bring the truth to the surface."
 
 # Event 3
 sw22_crisis.31.name: "Underground Terrorists "
 sw22_crisis.31.desc: "Our geological teams have been studying the unexpected seismic activity. Furthermore, we are starting to see some unexpected ecological damage in the surrounding area. Deep scans have uncovered a series of recently created tunnels under the affected area; it's too early to tell if it's naturally occurring, but regardless it is of concern."
 sw22_crisis.31.a: "Get a drilling team to investigate."

 sw22_crisis.32.name: "Foiled Erosion"
 sw22_crisis.32.desc: "The tunnel network is extensive, who or what dug them out has been at this for a while. The state in the tunnels indicates there is more ecological damage to come, what is already dying is only a portion of the tunnel network. We have yet to find those responsible, but will continue the search."
 sw22_crisis.32.a: "Dig to the truth."

 # Event 4
 sw22_crisis.41.name: "Worm Your Way Out Of This One"
 sw22_crisis.41.desc: "After a long and grueling search our soldiers found the source of the tunnel network. A giant alien worm of unknown origin was boring below the location where the environmental damage occurred and feeding on the dead soil it left behind. Our soldiers were barely able to slay the beast, its crystalline hide and regenerative qualities made it almost impervious to our weapons. The initial autopsy shows extensive, highly advanced bio-engineering, not dissimilar to some genetic techniques used by §R[sw22_accused.GetName]§!. This could be the prelude to an all out attack."
 sw22_crisis.41.a: "At least this planet is safe for now."


 # Event 5
 sw22_crisis.51.name: "They Hit Everyone"
 sw22_crisis.51.desc: "It appears [sw22_accused.GetName] hit dozens of planets and reports are still coming in. Why they decided now to attack everyone is beyond us, but the galactic community is up in arms. Already there are talks about sanctions and some even suggesting counterattacks."
 sw22_crisis.51.a: "How dare they."

 # Event 6
 sw22_crisis.61.desc.1: "Xenos, toasters, hiveminds and citizens of the galaxy. I stand before you on behalf of [sw22_accused.GetName]. We have prepared a statement: \n\nThe unfounded allegations that we are responsible for the attacks are nothing more than fantasy. Furthermore, one of our worlds was attacked as well, and we are as much victims as the rest of you.\n\nWe stand before the galactic community and condemn the attacks on the galaxy and will support any effort to hunt down the true perpetrators of this crime."
 sw22_crisis_61.1.a: "They Lie!"
 sw22_crisis_61.1.b: "Could they be telling the truth?"

 sw22_crisis.61.desc.2: "The accusation that our units are responsible for the worm attack is a false statement, and also presents flawed logic; one of our hubs was also attacked.\n\nBy our calculations there would be 247 more efficient ways to attack all empires simultaneously, which would dictate this attack is organic in nature.\n\nEnd transmission."
 sw22_crisis_61.2.a: "Defective Glorified Appliance!"
 sw22_crisis_61.2.b: "That is some sound logic."

 sw22_crisis.61.desc.3: "The [sw22_accused.GetName] is not responsible for the attacks, and furthermore, one of our nests was also attacked.\n\nThe individualistic nature of many of the galaxy's empires leads you to assume the worst in other creatures, but we know better as we are one.\n\nOne of you is responsible and when we find out which one we will eliminate the threat to the nest."
 sw22_crisis_61.3.a: "Lying Drone!"
 sw22_crisis_61.3.b: "What does it have to gain?"

 sw22_crisis.61.desc.4: "We are not responsible for the attacks on your worlds.\n\nWe wish we were.\n\nNever communicate with us ever again, filthy alien scum."
 sw22_crisis_61.4.a: "This should have been expected."
 sw22_crisis_61.4.b: "Ok if not them, then who?"

 sw22_situation.3.desc: "The Worm surfaced in a new part of [Root.GetName] and immediately shed a legion of attack wormlings. The local area is both dealing with the creatures and the ecological fallout."
 sw22_situation.3.a: "Horrific."
